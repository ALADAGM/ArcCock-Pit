# How to enable Cock-Pit on Day Zero 

## Arc Cock-Pit Prerequisites

- Permission on Subscription for [Azure Arc-enabled server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/prerequisites#required-permissions)
- Registering [Azure Arc Resource Providers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/prerequisites#azure-resource-providers)
- All the Windows/Linux Servers, SQL Servers, should be [Arc-Connected](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/agent-overview)
- Complete networking requirements for all the servers to be onboarded to Azure Arc
  - Define networking access from Firewall or Proxy for all the URLs. See details [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/network-requirements?tabs=azure-cloud)
  - For Private Link see the [details below](#azure-arc-cock-pit-via-private-link-architecture)
- Onboard all Windows/Linux servers, SQL Servers to Azure Arc by using [Azure Private Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/private-link-security)
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > All the servers installed Arc Connected Machine Agent includes SQL Server Extension automatically if the server has SQL Server installed.
- Deploy Azure Monitor or Log Analytics Agent Extension to all servers, systems to be onboarded into the Arc Cock-Pit
- Configure Azure Monitor Data Collection Rules or Log Analytics Performance Counters or  Logs to be collected based on your telemetry requirements
  - [Data collection rules in Azure Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-rule-overview)

## Private Link

### Azure Arc Cock-Pit via Private link Architecture

What is Private Link & Why Options

- Private connectivity to services on Azure traffic remains on the Microsoft network, with no public internet access
- Integration with on-premises and peered networks
- Protection against data exfiltration for Azure resources
- Services delivered directly to your customersâ€™ virtual networks
