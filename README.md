# Overview
Customers have sprawling server-based IT systems deployed in corporate datacenters, hosters, and public-cloud.
The sprawl is overwhelming, and it is impossible to manage and apply consistent governance, monitoring and security across the environment and meet compliance needs

# Business requirements
Out of the box creation of NOC and SOC capabilities in day one. 
Manage a mix of bare metal, Windows and Linux servers across locations and disparate systems
Visibility across locations, OS flavors, SQL instances and disparate systems
Manage, Secure, govern, Monitor environments, SQL workloads, servers, systems via Azure Arc
Security posture management and threat protection across hybrid cloud resources
Enable IT to apply at scale governance and security policies across all environments
Enable application owners to apply and audit to meet their own requirements
Measure and remediate compliance at scale and down to the individual workload/server 

# What is NOC (Network Operation Center)

“Network Operations Center (NOC) is the centralized platform from which information technology (IT) teams, either internal or outsourced; supervise, monitor, manage, and maintain organization systems, servers, platforms, services, and network.” 

# What is SOC (Security Operation Center )

“Security Operations Center (SOC) is the centralized platform responsible for monitoring and managing an organization's security posture, incident detection, and response. It is typically staffed by security professionals who are responsible for identifying, responding to and mitigating security threats. In short, a SOC team is responsible for making sure an organization is operating securely at all times…” ![image](https://github.com/ALADAGM/ArcCock-Pit/assets/3506526/e752d5a1-7626-4913-927f-7a6777348023)
